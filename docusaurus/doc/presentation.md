Speaker notes / TODO:

- Add a screenshot of me from last year showing a screenshot of me in the year before

## Agenda

1. RPC
2. Relay Mining
3. Probabilistic Proofs
4. Decentralizing Gateways
5. Open Questions (Collaboration Opportunities)

Speaker notes / TODO:

- Will be using Pocket Network as an example for decentralized supply network
- Will be using Grove as an example of a gateway facilitating access to it
- Discussing scalability issues
- Discussing user issues

## RPC (Intro Slide)

### RPC Trilemma Slide

- Reliability
- Performance
- Cost-effectiveness

### Open Problems with RPC

- Quality of Service: SLA / SLOW
- Incentivization: Free / Paid
- Schema Validation: What's offered?

### RPC in Web2

Speaker note:

### Scalability Issues Encountered

- What is a transaction

## Relay Mining (Intro Slide)

## Probabilistic Proof (Intro Slide)

## Decentralized Gateways (Intro Slide)

### Who is doing the work here?

- near.io
- ar.io
- Permanent domains
- END

### Which signatures?

- Options: Threshold signatures? Chain Signature? BLS? ECDSA?

## Open Questions (Intro Slide)

### On-Chain QoS

### Data Integrity
