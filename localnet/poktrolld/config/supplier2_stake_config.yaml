      # The endpoint URL for the Anvil service is provided via the RelayMiner.
      # The RelayMiner acts as a proxy, forwarding requests to the actual Anvil data node behind it.
      # This setup allows for flexible and dynamic service provisioning within the network.
      # TODO_IN_THIS_PR: Discuss with @okdas if this should be `relayminer2` instead of `relayminer1`
